Xbox Game Pass is one of the best values in gaming, but purchasing a full 12 month membership is not always straightforward.

If you visit the official Xbox site:

* [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass)

You will typically only see options for:

* 1 month
* 3 months

If you prefer paying annually instead of monthly, there is an alternative method.

## Step 1: Purchase a 12 Month Membership from Best Buy

Instead of buying directly from Xbox, you can purchase a 12 month digital membership from Best Buy:

* [https://www.bestbuy.com/product/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-essential-12-month-membership-digital](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-essential-12-month-membership-digital)

Why this works:

* Best Buy sells digital prepaid codes
* You receive a redemption code after purchase
* It avoids recurring monthly billing if that is your preference

After checkout, Best Buy will provide a digital code via email or in your account order history.

<br>

## Step 2: Redeem Your Code

Once you have your 12 month code, redeem it through the official Xbox redemption page:

* [https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/redeem-codes-gifting/redeem-prepaid-codes](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/redeem-codes-gifting/redeem-prepaid-codes)

From there:

* Log into your Microsoft account
* Enter the 25 character code
* Confirm the redemption

Your subscription time will be added to your account immediately.

<br>

## Important Notes

* Make sure you are logged into the correct Microsoft account before redeeming
* If you already have an active subscription, the 12 months will stack on top of your current time
* Digital codes are non-refundable once redeemed

<br>

## Why Choose 12 Months?

Buying annually instead of monthly can:

* Reduce billing management
* Lock in pricing
* Prevent accidental subscription lapses

For users who plan to keep Game Pass long term, purchasing a 12 month prepaid membership is often the simplest solution.

## Final Thoughts

While Xbox.com primarily promotes shorter subscription cycles, 12 month memberships are still available through authorized retailers like Best Buy.

By purchasing a prepaid digital code and redeeming it through the official Xbox portal, you can secure a full year of service without relying on recurring monthly charges.
