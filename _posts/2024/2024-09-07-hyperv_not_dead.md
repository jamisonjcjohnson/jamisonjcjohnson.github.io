In the world of virtualization, VMware often dominates the conversation. However, recent changes following [Broadcom's acquisition of VMware](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-completes-acquisition-vmware) have caused frustration among customers and partners, leading many to explore alternatives. One significant contender that frequently comes up is Hyper-V, Microsoft's hypervisor technology. Contrary to popular belief, Hyper-V is not being discontinued, and here's why it's still a viable and powerful option for virtualization. In this blog post, we will explain why Hyper-V remains a viable and powerful option for virtualization.

## The State of Hyper-V

Hyper-V remains a key player in the business and enterprise virtualization market. It holds the largest market share after VMware, integrates seamlessly with mainstream services like Veeam, and enjoys robust support within the IT community. Despite ongoing rumors, Hyper-V is not going anywhere. These misconceptions often stem from sensationalist headlines and misinterpretations of Microsoft's announcements.

<br>

### Misunderstanding the Discontinuation Rumors

The rumor mill suggests that Hyper-V was discontinued after Windows Server 2019 and that it will disappear once 2019 reaches its end of life. This is simply not true. Windows Server 2022, which has been available for a few years now, includes Hyper-V. Microsoft has also announced ongoing improvements to Hyper-V, including features like clustering and live migration between different generations of CPU, similar to VMware's Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC).

<br>

### The Importance of Hyper-V to Microsoft

Hyper-V is integral to several of Microsoft's key products and services:

- **Microsoft Azure**: This massive cloud platform runs on Hyper-V, underscoring its critical role.
- **Windows Security Features**: Some of the newest security enhancements in Windows are powered by Hyper-V.
- **Xbox**: Even Microsoft's gaming console relies on Hyper-V for certain functionalities.

Given its extensive use across various products, Microsoft is not going to halt the development of Hyper-V anytime soon.

<br>

## What Actually Got Discontinued?

The confusion primarily arises from the discontinuation of Microsoft Hyper-V Server, not Hyper-V itself. Microsoft Hyper-V Server was a standalone edition of Windows Server designed exclusively to run Hyper-V without any additional roles or features. It was similar to VMware's free ESXi hypervisor, offering a feature-limited version for free.

<br>

### Differences Between Hyper-V Server and Windows Server Hyper-V

- **Microsoft Hyper-V Server**: This was a stripped-down, "Core" version of Windows Server that only ran Hyper-V, with no graphical interface or additional server roles.
- **Windows Server Hyper-V**: This is the full version of Windows Server where Hyper-V is one of many features you can enable. It continues to be developed and supported.

By discontinuing Microsoft Hyper-V Server, Microsoft is simplifying its product lineup but not eliminating Hyper-V from Windows Server. 

<br>

## Licensing Considerations

A common concern is that the discontinuation of Microsoft Hyper-V Server might mean higher costs due to licensing. However, this concern is largely unfounded:

- **Licensing Hyper-V**: Hyper-V is part of Windows Server, so there is no separate licensing fee for using it. If you have a Windows Server license, you can use Hyper-V.
- **Windows Licensing**: Whether you run virtual machines on Hyper-V, VMware, Xen, or KVM, if they are Windows VMs, you need to license the physical hardware they run on.

For most users, the discontinuation of Microsoft Hyper-V Server makes little practical difference. If your infrastructure includes Windows workloads, you likely already have the necessary licenses.

<br>

## Conclusion

The narrative that Hyper-V is being phased out is incorrect. Hyper-V continues to be a critical component of Microsoft's ecosystem, with ongoing development and support. For those seeking an alternative to VMware, Hyper-V remains a powerful and viable option. The discontinuation of Microsoft Hyper-V Server, a free and limited version of Hyper-V, does not impact the full-featured Hyper-V that is part of Windows Server. In essence, Hyper-V is far from dead and continues to be a cornerstone of virtualization technology.

Stay informed and make sure to base your decisions on accurate information. Hyper-V is here to stay, providing a robust alternative in the virtualization landscape.
