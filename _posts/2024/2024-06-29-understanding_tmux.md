Imagine you're a developer knee-deep in Vim or NeoVim, juggling multiple CLI tools, or perhaps you're a DevOps wizard tailing logs and managing deployment workflows. If you're spending a lot of time in the terminal and haven't yet explored the wonders of tmux, you're missing out. If you're not already using Team UX (tmux), it's time to start. Imagine logging into your Linux server with one command and performing multiple tasks within seconds. That's the power of tmux. 

Let's walk you through why tmux is a game-changer and how it can revolutionize your workflow.

## Why Tmux?

Tmux is more than just a terminal multiplexer; it's a superpower for your command line. In this mini-course, starting with this video, I'll dive into why tmux is indispensable, how it operates, and showcase its features and functionalities. In subsequent videos, I'll guide you through customizing tmux for a visually appealing setup and demonstrate how I leverage tmux for maximum productivity in my daily workflow.

<br>

### What is Tmux?

Tmux stands for "terminal multiplexer." But what does that mean? Let me break it down for you. Traditionally, when you log into a terminal, you're confined to a single pseudo terminal instance at a time. With tmux, however, you can have multiple pseudo terminal logins tied to a single terminal session. This multiplexing capability allows for unparalleled flexibility and productivity. You can detach from a session, work on other tasks, and seamlessly reattach to your tmux environment with everything still running.

<br>

### Tmux Benefits

1. **Persistence**: Your tmux session persists across sessions. Detach, switch tasks, or even log out, and when you return, everything is exactly where you left it.
2. **Session Sharing**: Tmux allows for session sharing, enabling collaborative work and pair programming.
3. **Multiple Windows and Panes**: With tmux, you can organize your workflow into multiple windows and panes, making multitasking a breeze.

<br>

## Getting Started with Tmux

Let's dive into tmux and explore its core functionalities.

First, make sure tmux is installed by checking which version is installed:

```bash
tmux -V
```

If not, install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install tmux   #ubuntu
sudo dnf install tmux       #rhel
```

<br>

### Launching Tmux

To start tmux, simply enter the command `tmux` in your terminal. You'll enter a multiplexed terminal environment, indicated by the green status bar at the bottom.

<br>

### Windows in Tmux

Tmux allows you to create multiple windows within a session. Press `Ctrl + B`, followed by `C`, to create a new window. Use `Ctrl + B`, followed by a number, to switch between windows.

<br>

### Panes in Tmux

Panes enable you to split your terminal window into multiple sections. Split horizontally with `Ctrl + B`, followed by `%`, and vertically with `Ctrl + B`, followed by `"`. Navigate between panes using arrow keys or `Ctrl + B` combined with arrow keys.

<br>

### Renaming Windows and Sessions

You can easily rename windows and sessions in tmux. Enter command mode with `Ctrl + B`, followed by `:`, then use commands like `rename-window` or `rename-session` to give them meaningful names.

<br>

### Detaching and Reattaching

Detach from a tmux session with `Ctrl + B`, followed by `D`. Reattach to a session using `tmux attach`. You can list all sessions with `tmux ls` and switch between them with `Ctrl + B`, followed by `S`.

<br>

### Creating and Switching Sessions

To create a new tmux session, simply run `tmux` again. Switch between sessions using `Ctrl + B`, followed by `S`, then navigating with arrow keys.

<br>

### Copy Mode

Copy mode allows you to copy and paste text within tmux. 

**Enter copy mode:**

`Press Ctrl + B, then [`

Navigate to the desired text and press Space to start selection.

Move to the end of the text and press Enter to copy.

**Exit copy mode:**

`Press Ctrl + B, then ] to paste.`

<br>

### Customization

Edit your tmux configuration:

```bash
vi ~/.tmux.conf
```

Add the following lines for mouse support and vim-like keybindings:

```bash
set -g mouse on
setw -g mode-keys vi
```

<br>

## Conclusion

You've learned the basics of tmux. With its powerful features, tmux can significantly boost your productivity. Experiment with different configurations and keybindings to tailor it to your workflow. tmux empowers users to take control of their terminal environment, optimizing productivity and streamlining workflow management. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or anyone who spends a significant amount of time in the terminal, integrating tmux into your toolkit is sure to elevate your command-line experience to new heights. Embrace tmux, and unlock the true potential of your terminal.
