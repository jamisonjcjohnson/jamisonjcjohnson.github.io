## Enabling Line Numbers in Vim by Default

To have line numbers displayed by default in Vim, follow these steps:

<br>

### Editing the Vim Configuration File

**Locate the `/etc/vimrc` File:**
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/vimrc
   ```
**Add Line Number Configuration:**

Within the `/etc/vimrc` file, add the following line : 

   ```bash
    set nu
```
This command tells Vim to always display line numbers when you open files in the editor.

Save the changes and either restart Vim or open a new file to see line numbers enabled by default.

## Enabling Line Numbers Temporarily

You can also enable line numbers temporarily within the Vim editor by entering the following command within Vim:
  ```bash
    :set numbers
```

This command enables line numbers for the current session but doesn't save the setting for future use.

## Conclusion

Customizing Vim settings can significantly enhance your editing experience. Enabling line numbers by default is a practical configuration for better navigation and reference while working with multiple files. Utilize this method to streamline your workflow and increase productivity within the Vim text editor.
