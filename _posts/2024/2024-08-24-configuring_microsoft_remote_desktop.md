System administrators and IT professionals often seek streamlined methods for deploying software across multiple systems without relying on user intervention or third-party platforms like the Mac App Store. Responding to this need, Microsoft has made its Remote Desktop application available as a standalone installer, independent of the App Store.

## Why Use the Standalone Installer?

The standalone installer for Microsoft Remote Desktop provides several benefits:

- **Ease of Deployment**: Admins can distribute the application using standard package management tools without requiring users to interact with the Mac App Store.
- **Consistent Updates**: The standalone version can be kept up-to-date via Microsoft AutoUpdate, ensuring it stays in sync with the App Store releases.
- **Streamlined Management**: This method aligns with how other software packages are managed, simplifying the workflow for System administrators.

## Keeping the Application Updated

One of the significant advantages of using the standalone installer is its compatibility with Microsoft AutoUpdate. This ensures that Microsoft Remote Desktop stays updated alongside other Microsoft applications like Office and Skype for Business.

To ensure automatic updates:

1. **Install Microsoft AutoUpdate**: If not already installed, you can obtain Microsoft AutoUpdate from the same download page. It's typically bundled with other Microsoft applications, so you may already have it on your systems.

2. **Enable AutoUpdate**: Once installed, Microsoft AutoUpdate will handle updates for Microsoft Remote Desktop, keeping it in sync with the App Store releases.

By using the standalone installer and leveraging Microsoft AutoUpdate, administrators can ensure that their systems remain up-to-date and secure, all while streamlining the overall management process.
