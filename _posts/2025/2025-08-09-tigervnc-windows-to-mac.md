In today’s world of remote access and virtual desktops, it’s often necessary to control other machines from your device. Whether you’re managing a server, working remotely, or simply need to access a desktop environment away from home, tools like **TigerVNC** and **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** make it simple.  

TigerVNC is an open-source VNC server and client, providing a graphical interface for remote control of computers, while RDP is built into most versions of Windows, allowing easy remote desktop access. This combination allows you to securely connect to a Mac from Windows, even if macOS doesn’t natively support RDP.  

In this blog post, we will walk through downloading and setting up TigerVNC on Windows, enabling VNC on a Mac, and connecting from Windows using RDP.

## Why Use TigerVNC and RDP?

* **TigerVNC** – Open-source, cross-platform VNC server and client for graphical remote control. Ideal for administrators and remote workers.  
* **RDP** – Built-in Windows protocol for accessing remote desktops, offering a familiar interface and smooth performance.  
* **Combined Benefit** – Securely connect from Windows to macOS using a combination of VNC for compatibility and RDP for ease of use.

## Step 1: Download and Install TigerVNC on Windows

* Visit the [official TigerVNC website](https://tigervnc.org/) and download the latest Windows version.  
* Navigate to the **Downloads** section, selecting the correct version for your system (most will use 64-bit).  
* Run the installer and follow the prompts. Choose **Complete installation** to install both the Server and Viewer.  
* Check the option **Add TigerVNC to PATH** so you can use its commands from anywhere.  
* Launch **TigerVNC Viewer** — this will be your client application for connecting to the Mac.

## Step 2: Set Up VNC on macOS

* On your Mac, open **System Settings/Preferences** → **General** → **Sharing**.  
* Check **Screen Sharing** to enable remote graphical access.  
* Click on the small "i" next to **Screen Sharing**, then click **Computer Settings** and check **VNC viewers may control screen with password**.  
* Set a secure password for the connection.  

Your Mac is now ready to accept VNC connections from TigerVNC Viewer on your Windows machine.

<br>  

## Step 3: Connect to the Mac Using VNC 

* Launch **TigerVNC** on your Windows machine.  
* Enter your Mac’s IP address (find it in **System Settings/Preferences** → **Network**).  
* Click **Show Options**, enter your Mac’s credentials, and click **Connect**.  

If you’re using VNC directly, simply enter your Mac’s IP and password into TigerVNC Viewer.

## Conclusion

Using TigerVNC on Windows to connect to a Mac — either directly via VNC or with RDP through a bridge — is a reliable and practical remote access solution. With minimal setup, you can securely and efficiently manage a Mac from a Windows environment, even without native RDP support in macOS.  

This method is especially useful for cross-platform work scenarios where compatibility and accessibility are essential.
