Nextcloud is a powerful self-hosted collaboration suite‚Äîbut by default, it lacks the ability to edit Office documents like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint directly in the browser. OnlyOffice fills this gap by providing a robust, Microsoft-compatible document editor you can run on your own infrastructure.

In this blog post, we‚Äôll walk through the process of integrating a self-hosted OnlyOffice server with a Nextcloud instance. This guide covers the installation of the OnlyOffice app in Nextcloud and the necessary configuration to link the two systems.

## Requirements

- A working **Nextcloud** instance (version 20+ recommended)
- A separate, self-hosted **OnlyOffice Document Server**
- HTTPS certificates on the OnlyOffice server
- Access to both servers via browser and terminal
- Admin privileges in your Nextcloud instance

<br>

## Step 1: Install the OnlyOffice App in Nextcloud

To enable integration between Nextcloud and your OnlyOffice server:

- Log in to your **Nextcloud** web interface as an **admin** user.
- Click your profile picture in the top-right corner, then go to **Apps**.
- In the left-hand menu, click **Tools**.
- Search for **OnlyOffice** using the search bar.
- Click **Download and enable**.

This installs the official OnlyOffice integration app within your Nextcloud system.

## Step 2: Configure the OnlyOffice Integration

Once the app is installed:

- Go to **Settings > Administration > ONLYOFFICE**.
- Enter the following values:

   - **ONLYOFFICE Docs address**:  
     `https://onlyoffice.domain.org/`

   - **Secret key**:  
     Copy this from your OnlyOffice server‚Äôs configuration file:  
     **/etc/onlyoffice/documentserver/local.json**

     Look for the `secret` field under any section (`inbox`, `outbox`, or `session`) ‚Äî the value is the same in all of them.

   - **Authorization header**:  
     `AuthorizationJWT`

- Click **Save**.

<br>

## Step 3: Verify the Integration

Now that everything is connected:

- Navigate to your **Files** section in Nextcloud.
- Upload a `.docx`, `.xlsx`, or `.pptx` file.
- Click on the file ‚Äî it should open in the browser using OnlyOffice.

You can now create and edit documents inside of Nextcloud. Without OnlyOffice, this feature is not available.

<br>

## Conclusion

Connecting OnlyOffice to your Nextcloud server enables powerful in-browser editing of Office documents, completely self-hosted and under your control. With just a few steps ‚Äî installing the app, configuring the connection, and setting the shared secret‚Äîyou unlock seamless integration between file storage and document editing.

If you're looking for a secure and private Google Docs alternative, this setup is a great place to start.
