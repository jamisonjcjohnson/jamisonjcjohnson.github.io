## Design and Build Quality

The VIVO STAND-V001T immediately impresses with its **sturdy construction**. Built from high-grade steel and aluminum, it supports monitors up to 32 inches and 22 pounds with ease. The matte black finish not only looks sleek but also resists fingerprints and scratches â€” ensuring it maintains a professional aesthetic over time.

Its **extra-tall pole**, standing at 39 inches, is what truly sets this model apart. This additional height gives users far greater flexibility for ergonomic monitor placement, especially for tall individuals or setups involving standing desks.
