## **Why Consider OpenWRT?**
The stock firmware on TP-Link access points works well for basic setups, but when you‚Äôre managing multiple VLANs, advanced security, and traffic optimization, OpenWRT opens up a world of possibilities:

- **Advanced Network Control:** OpenWRT gives you deep control over firewall rules, VLAN tagging, and interface assignments ‚Äî perfect for keeping your Eufy camera traffic local.
- **Enhanced Wireless Performance:** You can fine-tune power levels, channel selection, and bandwidth, which is crucial when managing 12 access points without any nearby Wi-Fi interference.
- **Flexibility with Packages:** OpenWRT supports a huge library of additional packages, so you can add advanced tools like `luci-app-sqm` for traffic shaping or `wpad-openssl` for improved wireless security.

## **Performance on the EAP615-Wall**
The EAP615-Wall is a compact and powerful Wi-Fi 6 access point, and OpenWRT takes full advantage of its hardware:

- **Stable Mesh Networking:** If you‚Äôre using mesh configurations, OpenWRT offers better support and stability for wireless backhaul.
- **VLAN Integration:** With your existing VLAN setup on pfSense, OpenWRT makes it easy to align those networks on your WAPs without interference or sync issues.
- **Improved Security:** You get faster updates and community-driven security patches ‚Äî critical when running IoT devices like your Eufy cameras.

<br>

## **Potential Drawbacks**
While OpenWRT brings a lot of power, it‚Äôs not without some challenges:

- **Steep Learning Curve:** If you‚Äôre not familiar with OpenWRT, the sheer number of options can feel overwhelming.
- **Manual Configuration:** Stock firmware often comes pre-optimized for the hardware. With OpenWRT, you‚Äôll spend more time tweaking settings for optimal performance.
- **Compatibility:** Not every feature of the EAP615-Wall‚Äôs hardware may be fully supported yet, depending on the OpenWRT version.

## Conclusion

Running OpenWRT on the TP-Link EAP615-Wall brings a level of control and performance that stock firmware simply can‚Äôt match. With advanced features like VLAN support, traffic shaping, and flexible package management, it‚Äôs an excellent choice for anyone managing a complex network or looking to optimize wireless performance. 

<br>

That said, OpenWRT isn‚Äôt a plug-and-play solution. It requires careful setup and a willingness to dive into network configuration. But if you‚Äôre ready to take your network‚Äôs reliability, security, and performance to the next level, the combination of OpenWRT and the EAP615-Wall is a powerful and flexible solution worth considering.
