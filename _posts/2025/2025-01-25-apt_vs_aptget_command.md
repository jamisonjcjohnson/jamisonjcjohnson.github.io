When managing software packages on Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu, two commonly used commands are `apt` and `apt-get`. Both are part of the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) suite and facilitate package management tasks such as installation, removal, and updates. 

However, many users wonder which command to use and how they differ. This blog post will delve into the distinctions between `apt` and `apt-get`, their unique features, and when to use each.

## Overview of `apt` and `apt-get`

### `apt-get`
Introduced in Debian in 1998, `apt-get` is a command-line tool designed for advanced users and scripts. It provides powerful and granular control over package management tasks but lacks some usability features compared to newer tools.

### `apt`
Introduced in Ubuntu 16.04, `apt` is a more user-friendly command-line interface built on top of `apt-get`. It combines the functionality of multiple commands (`apt-get`, `apt-cache`, etc.) and introduces improved output formatting and additional features, making it ideal for interactive use.

## Key Differences Between `apt` and `apt-get`

| Feature                           | `apt-get`                                 | `apt`                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Usability**                     | Basic, script-oriented                    | User-friendly, interactive            |
| **Output**                        | Verbose and raw                           | Simplified and formatted              |
| **Combined Commands**             | Requires separate commands                | Unified commands for easier use       |
| **Interactive Prompts**           | No (non-interactive by default)           | Includes interactive prompts          |
| **Default Features**              | Granular control, no auto-remove          | Includes auto-remove for dependencies |

## Common Commands: `apt` vs `apt-get`

Here are some examples of how similar tasks are performed using `apt` and `apt-get`:

### 1. **Updating Package Lists**
   - `apt-get`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - `apt`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

<br>

### 2. **Upgrading Installed Packages**
   - `apt-get`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get upgrade
     ```
   - `apt`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

<br>

### 3. **Full Upgrade (Including Removals and Replacements)**
   - `apt-get`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
     ```
   - `apt`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt full-upgrade
     ```

<br>

### 4. **Installing a Package**
   - `apt-get`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install <package-name>
     ```
   - `apt`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install <package-name>
     ```

<br>

### 5. **Removing Unused Dependencies**
   - `apt-get`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get autoremove
     ```
   - `apt` (Included automatically during `apt remove`):
     ```bash
     sudo apt autoremove
     ```

## When to Use `apt` or `apt-get`

### Use `apt` If:
- You are working interactively on a terminal.
- You prefer clean and concise output.
- You want an easier-to-use interface that combines multiple commands.

### Use `apt-get` If:
- You are writing scripts or automation tasks where detailed control and stability are essential.
- You need backward compatibility with older systems or tools.

<br>

## Recommendations

For most users managing packages interactively, `apt` is the recommended choice due to its simplicity and user-friendly features. However, for scripting and complex package management scenarios, `apt-get` remains a robust and reliable tool.

<br>

## Conclusion

Both `apt` and `apt-get` are powerful tools for managing software packages on Debian-based systems. Understanding their differences and strengths helps you choose the right tool for your specific needs. While `apt` is designed for convenience and modern workflows, `apt-get` retains its relevance for advanced and automated tasks. By selecting the appropriate command, you can optimize your Linux package management experience.
