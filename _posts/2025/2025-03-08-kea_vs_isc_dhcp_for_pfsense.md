When configuring **pfSense** as a DHCP server, you have two primary options: **ISC DHCP** (the traditional choice) and **KEA DHCP** (a modern alternative). Both serve the same fundamental purpose‚Äî**dynamic IP address assignment**‚Äîbut they differ in architecture, features, and performance.

This blog post compares **KEA DHCP** and **ISC DHCP** to help you decide which is best for your **pfSense deployment**.

## ISC DHCP: The Traditional Workhorse

**ISC DHCP** (Internet Systems Consortium DHCP) has been the **default DHCP server** for pfSense for many years. It‚Äôs widely used and well-supported, but it has some limitations.

### Pros of ISC DHCP
‚úî **Mature and Stable** ‚Äì Decades of development and widespread adoption.  
‚úî **Deep pfSense Integration** ‚Äì Works seamlessly with **pfSense‚Äôs web interface**.  
‚úî **Supports DHCP Failover** ‚Äì Can be set up for **load balancing and redundancy**.  
‚úî **Static Mappings & Custom Options** ‚Äì Easily configure **static leases, PXE boot, and option overrides**.

<br>

### Cons of ISC DHCP
‚ùå **Single-Threaded** ‚Äì Performance bottlenecks under heavy loads.  
‚ùå **Configuration Reloads Disrupt Service** ‚Äì Any configuration change requires a **restart**, momentarily dropping active leases.  
‚ùå **End of Life in Sight** ‚Äì ISC is **phasing out support** for ISC DHCP in favor of KEA DHCP.

<br>

## KEA DHCP: The Next Generation

**KEA DHCP** is the **modern replacement** for ISC DHCP, offering a **more scalable and flexible** solution. It is actively developed by the **Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)** and is expected to fully replace ISC DHCP in the future.

<br>

### Pros of KEA DHCP
‚úî **Multi-Threaded Performance** ‚Äì Handles **higher loads** more efficiently.  
‚úî **Live Configuration Changes** ‚Äì No need to restart the service when modifying settings.  
‚úî **Database Support** ‚Äì Stores lease data in **MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Cassandra**, making it easier to manage in large environments.  
‚úî **High Availability via Hooks** ‚Äì Supports **customizable HA setups** beyond traditional failover.  
‚úî **REST API for Automation** ‚Äì Enables **dynamic, API-driven DHCP configurations**.

### Cons of KEA DHCP
‚ùå **Limited pfSense Integration** ‚Äì As of now, **pfSense does not fully support KEA DHCP** through the web UI.  
‚ùå **More Complex Configuration** ‚Äì Requires **JSON-based configurations** instead of traditional text files.  
‚ùå **Some Advanced Features Require Paid Hooks** ‚Äì Features like **failover and lease reservation hooks** require a **support subscription** from ISC.  

<br>

## Which One Should You Use?

### Use ISC DHCP if:
- You want **full pfSense web UI integration**.  
- You need **simple DHCP management** with traditional features.  
- You rely on **pfSense‚Äôs built-in failover and static mappings**.  

<br>

### Use KEA DHCP if:
- You need **higher performance** in large environments.  
- You prefer **database-backed DHCP management**.  
- You require **real-time configuration changes** without service interruptions.  
- You want **API-based automation** for dynamic networks.  

For most **pfSense users**, **ISC DHCP is still the best choice** due to **ease of configuration and full web UI support**. However, as **KEA DHCP matures**, it will likely become the **default DHCP solution** for pfSense in the future.

<br>

## **Conclusion**

While **ISC DHCP** remains the default choice for pfSense due to its simplicity and **tight integration**, **KEA DHCP** offers **significant advantages** in performance, scalability, and automation. If you manage a **large network** or require **dynamic configurations**, KEA might be worth the extra setup effort.

For now, **pfSense users should stick with ISC DHCP**, but keep an eye on **future updates** as KEA DHCP continues to gain support. Eventually, pfSense will likely transition fully to KEA DHCP as **ISC DHCP reaches end-of-life**.

Would you switch to **KEA DHCP** now, or wait until **pfSense provides full support**? Let me know in the comments!
