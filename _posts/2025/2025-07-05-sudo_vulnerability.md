A critical vulnerability was recently identified in the widely-used `sudo` utility, affecting systems that rely on host-based rules in the `sudoers` file. Known as **CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë32462**, this bug allows low-privileged local users to escalate to root by abusing the `-h/--host` option. Discovered by [Rich Mirch of Stratascale](https://blog.mirch.io/sudo-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerabilities/) and present in `sudo` for over a decade, this flaw highlights the need for diligent patching‚Äîeven in mature tools like `sudo`.

In the blog post, we‚Äôll cover what the issue is, how it works, how to detect it, and most importantly, how to fix it.

## What‚Äôs Going On?

- The `-h/--host` flag in `sudo` was originally intended to list how a user‚Äôs permissions apply on different hosts‚Äînot for executing commands.  
- Due to a logic oversight, this flag could be misused to **apply permissions from a different host context**, effectively bypassing host-based restrictions in the `sudoers` file.

## Who Is at Risk?

- **Environments using host-based `sudoers` rules**, especially with `Host` or `Host_Alias` directives‚Äîtypical in LDAP or multi-machine setups.
- **All versions** of `sudo` from 1.8.8 up to, but not including, **1.9.17p1**.
- Affects major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Red‚ÄØHat, SUSE, Alpine, Amazon Linux, etc.) and Unix-like systems including macOS.

<br>

## How It Works

- An attacker with a low-privileged account on `hostA` uses:

```bash
sudo -h hostB <allowed-command>
```

- `sudo` applies permissions intended for `hostB`, not `hostA`.
- Even if the user is restricted on `hostA`, they can now run root commands that are permitted on `hostB`.

<br>

## Detection & Testing

- Search your `sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/` files for `Host` or `Host_Alias` directives.
- Attempt the exploit by running a harmless command with `-h` to test if host-based rules are enforced.

Example:
```bash
sudo -h <trusted-host> -l
```

If host-based restrictions don‚Äôt apply as expected, your `sudo` version is vulnerable.

<br>

## Fix and Recommendations

- Upgrade sudo to `v1.9.17p1` or later using your distro‚Äôs package manager. 
- Review `sudoers` configurations‚Äîminimize the use of host-based rules.
- For added security, monitor `sudo` usage and consider removing the `-h` option or move toward centralized authorization (e.g., LDAP).

<br>

## Conclusion

This vulnerability shows that even seasoned tools like `sudo` can harbor high-impact bugs when new flags are introduced. If your setup uses host-specific rules in `sudoers`, your systems are at risk unless updated.

**Next steps:**

- Patch systems immediately to v1.9.17p1 or newer.
- Audit `sudoers` for host-based policies.
- Continue security reviews for foundational tools.
